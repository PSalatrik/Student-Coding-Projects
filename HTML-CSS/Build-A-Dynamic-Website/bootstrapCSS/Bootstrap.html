The Michigan Strategic Fund, an arm of the Michigan Economic Development Corp., today approved a $3.5 million equity investment for Detroit developer The Roxbury Group to redevelop the tower at 3800 Woodward Ave. into The Plaza. Roxbury Group is backing the project through its ownership entity, The Plaza Midtown LLC.
 
The $21.1 million project is expected to include 72 apartments — 51 one-bedroom units, 19 two-bedroom units and two three-bedroom units — and 2,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space, the MEDC said.
 
The developer also will update the building’s mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems while restoring the façade in keeping with its original mid-century modern architectural look. The MEDC said the building, built in 1965 and vacant since 2013, is considered functionally obsolete.
 
MEDC said The Plaza project, along with a $68 million renovation of Wayne State University Physician Group’s clinical space next door, “represents the redeployment of nearly five acres in the heart of Midtown that as recently as last year sat entirely vacant, with a total investment across the two sites of over $100 million.”
 
The Plaza also will help link Woodward Avenue between Mack Avenue and the new Detroit Red Wings arena district development roughly bounded by Charlotte Street to Grand Circus Park, add residential units in a high-demand area along the new M-1 streetcar line and increase walkability through the corridor, the state said.
 
The MSF also approved a change to a state brownfield tax credit for the project previously approved in December 2010 — worth $927,000 — to renovate the existing tower, rather than demolish it and rebuild. A construction timeline was not immediately available.
 
Roxbury Group also has $12.2 million in financing from Arlington, Va.-based Capital Impact Partners, which has a Detroit office, plus an estimated $3.2 million in equity from an unnamed historic tax credit investor, the MEDC said. The property owner will contribute another $1.7 million.
 
The city of Detroit is contributing a 12-year tax credit worth $4.2 million under the state’s Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act, the state said.
 
Roxbury Group’s previous projects include:
The $94.5 million David Whitney Building into 108 apartments
The 136-room Aloft Detroit hotel and Grand Cirque Brasserie restaurant
The $12.3 million renovation of The Auburn apartments, with 58 units and retail space
Redevelopment of the Globe Trading Co. building into a $12.8 million outdoor activity center for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.
The company received $4.8 million in Michigan Strategic Fund equity financing for The Griswold, which will have residential units spanning five stories atop the Westin Book Cadillac hotel parking deck, according to the state. The MEDC said that project should close on its financing in the next month and start construction by early December.</p></div>
